## 🎯 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Watchtime Tracking & Rewards
**What it does:** Automatically tracks how long viewers watch your streams and rewards them with Discord roles.

**How it works:**
- Bot monitors your Kick chat in real-time
- Every minute of watching = 1 minute tracked
- Hit milestones → Get Discord roles automatically
- Example: 1 hour watched → "Fan" role, 12 hours → "Veteran" role

**Benefits:**
- Encourages viewers to stay longer
- Builds community loyalty
- Recognizes your most dedicated fans
- 100% automatic - no manual management

**Configuration:**
```
!roles add @Fan 60        # Fan role at 1 hour
!roles add @Veteran 720   # Veteran at 12 hours
!roles add @Legend 4320   # Legend at 3 days
```

---

### 2️⃣ One-Click Account Linking
**What it does:** Links Discord accounts to Kick usernames instantly with OAuth.

**The Old Way (Manual):**
1. User types command
2. User edits Kick bio
3. User waits for verification
4. Admin manually checks
❌ Time-consuming, error-prone

**The New Way (Automated):**
1. User clicks button or reacts to message
2. User clicks OAuth link
3. Done! Instantly linked
✅ 3 seconds, zero errors

**Setup:**
```
!setup_link_panel 🔗
```
Creates a pinned message. Users react with 🔗 → Get their link → Click → Done!

**Security:**
- Cryptographically signed URLs (HMAC-SHA256)
- 1-hour expiration on links
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (industry standard)
- No password sharing or manual verification needed

---

### 3️⃣ Monthly Raffle System
**What it does:** Automated monthly raffles where viewers earn tickets through engagement.

**How Viewers Earn Tickets:**
- **Watchtime:** 10 tickets per hour watched
- **Gifted Subs:** 15 tickets per sub gifted
- **Shuffle Wagers:** 20 tickets per $1000 wagered (code: 'lele')

**Features:**
- Fully automated monthly cycles
- Fair cryptographic random drawing
- Real-time ticket tracking
- Live leaderboards

```

**Auto-Draw:** Bot automatically draws a winner on the 1st of each month at midnight.

---

### 4️⃣ Guess the Balance (GTB) Game
**What it does:** Interactive betting game where viewers guess your final balance after slots.

**How It Works:**
1. Admin starts a GTB session with prize amount
2. Viewers submit guesses via Discord button
3. Admin enters final balance when done
4. Bot automatically finds closest guess and pays winner

**Example Session:**
```
Starting Balance: $1,000
Prize Pool: $50

Viewers guess:
- @Alice: $2,500
- @Bob: $850
- @Charlie: $1,200

Prize: $50 paid automatically

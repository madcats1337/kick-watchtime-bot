📢 **BOT UPDATE - November 2024**

Hey everyone! 👋

Just pushed a major update to improve the bot's organization and reliability. Here's what changed:

## 🛠️ **Backend Improvements**

**Code Reorganization:**
- Completely reorganized the bot's file structure for better maintainability
- All features now live in logical folders (games, slot requests, linking, etc.)
- This makes future updates faster and more reliable!

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed deployment issues that were causing the bot to crash on startup
- Updated all import paths to work with the new structure
- Resolved gunicorn configuration errors

**Documentation Updates:**
- Added comprehensive client presentation document
- Updated README with new folder structure
- Fixed all setup guide references to point to correct file locations

## ✅ **What This Means For You**

**Nothing changes on your end!** All commands work exactly the same:
- ✅ Watchtime tracking - still working
- ✅ Account linking - still working  
- ✅ Raffle system - still working
- ✅ GTB game - still working
- ✅ Slot request tracker - still working

This was purely a "behind the scenes" update to make the bot more stable and easier to maintain going forward.

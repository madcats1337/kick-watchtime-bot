📢 **BOT UPDATE - November 2024**

Hey everyone! 👋

Just pushed a major update with multi-platform wager tracking and improved command list! Here's what changed:

## � **New Features**

**Multi-Platform Wager Tracking:**
- Bot now supports multiple gambling platforms (Shuffle, Stake, Stake.us, and more!)
- Each deployment can be configured for your preferred platform
- Supports tracking multiple campaign/affiliate codes simultaneously
- Ticket rewards fully configurable per platform
- Automatic migration preserves all existing wager data

**Multiple Campaign Code Support:**
- Track multiple affiliate codes in one variable (e.g., your code + partner codes)
- Simply separate codes with commas: `lele,yourcode`
- Perfect for streamers with multiple affiliations

**Command List Updates:**
- Split command list into two separate commands:
  - `!commandlist` - Shows commands for regular users (clean and simple)
  - `!admincommands` - Shows all administrator commands
- Fixed and updated with accurate current commands
- Removed outdated/fake commands that no longer exist
- Added missing commands like `!tickets`, `!raffleboard`, `!raffleinfo`

## 🛠️ **Technical Improvements**

**Database Migration:**
- Automatic platform column added to wager tables
- Full backwards compatibility with existing Shuffle data
- No data loss or service interruption

**Configuration:**
- New environment variables for platform customization
- Flexible ticket reward rates per platform
- Configurable polling intervals

## ✅ **What This Means For You**

**For Regular Users:**
All your existing commands work exactly the same! The bot is just more powerful and flexible now.

**For Admins/Streamers:**
- You can now configure the bot to track ANY gambling platform (not just Shuffle!)
- Set your own ticket reward rates
- Track multiple affiliate codes at once
- Full control via environment variables

Everything is backwards compatible - existing Shuffle setups continue working with zero changes required!

# ✅ Phase 2 Complete: Watchtime Integration

## What We Built

### Files Created
- ✅ `raffle_system/watchtime_converter.py` - Automatic watchtime → tickets conversion
- ✅ `test_watchtime_converter.py` - Test suite for the converter

### Files Modified  
- ✅ `bot.py` - Added raffle system initialization in `on_ready()`

## How It Works

### Automatic Conversion (Every Hour)

The `WatchtimeConverter` runs as a Discord bot task every hour and:

1. **Queries watchtime table** - Gets all users with accumulated watchtime
2. **Joins with links table** - Only converts for users who have linked Discord ↔ Kick accounts
3. **Checks previous conversions** - Queries `raffle_watchtime_converted` to avoid double-counting
4. **Calculates new tickets** - Converts full hours only (60 minutes = 10 tickets)
5. **Awards tickets** - Updates `raffle_tickets` table
6. **Logs conversion** - Records in `raffle_watchtime_converted` and `raffle_ticket_log`

### Example Flow

```
User "viewer123" has:
- Total watchtime: 420 minutes (7 hours)
- Previously converted: 180 minutes (3 hours, 30 tickets)

New conversion:
- Unconverted: 420 - 180 = 240 minutes
- Convertible hours: 240 / 60 = 4 hours
- Tickets to award: 4 × 10 = 40 tickets

Result:
- User gets 40 more tickets
- Total tickets from watchtime: 70
- Next conversion will start from 420 minutes
```

### Key Features

✅ **No double-counting** - Tracks what watchtime has been converted per period  
✅ **Only full hours** - Partial hours don't convert (prevents fractional tickets)  
✅ **Linked users only** - Requires Discord ↔ Kick account linking  
✅ **Audit trail** - Every conversion logged in `raffle_ticket_log`  
✅ **Per-period tracking** - Resets when new raffle period starts  

## Integration with Bot

The watchtime converter is now integrated into your Discord bot:

```python
# In bot.py on_ready()
await setup_watchtime_converter(bot, engine)
```

This starts a background task that runs every hour.

## Configuration

From `raffle_system/config.py`:

```python
WATCHTIME_TICKETS_PER_HOUR = 10  # 1 hour = 10 tickets
WATCHTIME_CONVERSION_INTERVAL = 3600  # Run every 1 hour (seconds)
```

You can adjust these values to change the conversion rate and frequency.

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python test_watchtime_converter.py
```

Test results:
- ✅ Creates test users with watchtime
- ✅ Converts full hours to tickets
- ✅ Tracks converted watchtime
- ✅ Prevents double-counting
- ✅ Shows unconverted watchtime
- ✅ Handles incremental conversions

## Database Tables Used

### Read From:
- `watchtime` - Total minutes watched per user
- `links` - Discord ↔ Kick account mappings
- `raffle_periods` - Current active period

### Write To:
- `raffle_tickets` - User ticket balances (watchtime_tickets column)
- `raffle_watchtime_converted` - Track what's been converted
- `raffle_ticket_log` - Audit trail of all ticket changes

## Next Steps

The watchtime integration is complete and ready for production! 

**Phase 3 next:** Gifted Sub Tracking
- Listen for Kick websocket gifted sub events
- Award 15 tickets per gifted sub
- Immediate ticket awarding (not hourly)

## 4. Account Linking

- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your linked accounts
- We reserve the right to unlink accounts that violate these Terms
- You may request to unlink your account at any time by contacting a server administrator or using the `/unlink` command

## 5. Watchtime Tracking

- Watchtime is tracked based on chat activity in the monitored Kick.com channel
- You must be actively participating in chat to earn watchtime
- Anti-farming protections are in place to ensure fair tracking
- Daily watchtime limits may be enforced (default: 18 hours)
- Watchtime data is calculated based on chat messages and may not reflect exact viewing time
- Watchtime contributes to raffle tickets for weekly/monthly draws

## 6. Slot Request System

- Slot requests are subject to availability and streamer discretion
- Requests are picked using a provably fair random selection algorithm
- Slot rewards (tips/bonus buys) are determined using the same provably fair system
- Only verified (linked) users are eligible for slot rewards
- All provably fair data is publicly verifiable at `/provably-fair/winners`

## 7. Raffle and Giveaway Systems

- Raffles and giveaways use provably fair algorithms
- Winners are selected using cryptographically secure random selection
- All draws can be independently verified using the provided seeds and hashes
- Entry requirements and eligibility are set by server administrators
- Prize distribution is at the discretion of server administrators

## 8. Point Shop

- Points are earned through chat activity and watchtime
- Point balances are server-specific and non-transferable
- Points have no real monetary value
- Point shop items and pricing are set by server administrators
- We reserve the right to adjust point balances for system integrity

## 9. Prohibited Activities

You may NOT:
- Use multiple accounts to farm watchtime, points, or entries (alt accounts)
- Attempt to manipulate or exploit the tracking or randomization systems
- Share or sell your linked account
- Use automated tools, bots, or scripts to generate fake activity
- Harass, abuse, or spam other users
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its database
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or modify the Service's code
- Abuse the slot request or giveaway systems
- Attempt to predict or manipulate provably fair outcomes

## 10. Provably Fair System

- The Service uses provably fair algorithms for slot picks, raffles, and giveaways
- Server seeds are generated using cryptographically secure random generation
- All random outcomes can be verified using SHA-256 hash verification
- Verification tools are publicly available at `/provably-fair/winners#verify`
- We do not and cannot manipulate provably fair outcomes

## 11. Subscriptions and Billing

LeleBot offers a free tier and paid subscription tiers. Subscriptions apply per Discord server.

**Tiers and pricing:**
- **Tier 1 (Free):** Bonus Hunt, Slot Requests, Guess the Balance, and OBS widgets for those features. No payment required.
- **Tier 2 ($20.00 USD / month):** Everything in Tier 1, plus the Browser Extension, Point Shop and Point Rewards, Custom Commands, Timed Messages, Giveaways, and a personal sub-domain.
- **Tier 3 ($35.00 USD / month):** Everything in Tier 2, plus full dashboard access (activity logs, role-based access control, and all settings), Raffle, Clips, Wager tracking, and hands-on setup help.

Feature availability by tier is current as of the "Last Updated" date and may change; the in-app pricing page reflects the then-current offering.

**Payment processing:**
- Paid subscriptions are processed by **Stripe, Inc.**, our third-party payment processor. By subscribing, you also agree to Stripe's terms and authorize Stripe to charge your payment method on a recurring monthly basis.
- We do not collect or store your full payment card details. Card data is handled by Stripe. We store only a Stripe customer identifier, a subscription identifier, your current subscription tier and status, and the date the current billing period ends (see the Privacy Policy).

**Billing, renewal, and cancellation:**
- Paid subscriptions are billed monthly in advance and renew automatically until cancelled.
- You may cancel at any time from the Billing page in your dashboard (which opens the Stripe billing portal). When you cancel, your paid features remain active until the end of the current billing period, after which the server is downgraded to the Free tier.
- If a payment fails, the subscription may be marked past due and the server downgraded to the Free tier until payment is resolved.

**Refunds:**
- Payments are **non-refundable**, except where a refund is required by applicable law. Cancelling stops future charges; it does not refund the current or prior billing periods.

**Downgrades and your data:**
- Downgrading or cancelling locks the paid features but **does not delete your server's data**. If you re-subscribe, your data and configuration are restored.

**Price changes:**
- We may change subscription pricing or the features included in a tier. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to communicate material changes in advance. Price changes do not apply to a billing period you have already paid for.

## 12. Data Collection and Privacy

- The Service collects and stores data as described in our Privacy Policy
- By using the Service, you consent to data collection as outlined in the Privacy Policy
- Data is stored securely and used only for Service functionality

## 13. Termination

We reserve the right to:
- Terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time

- Modify or discontinue the Service at any time

Reasons for termination may include:
- Violation of these Terms
- Fraudulent or illegal activity

## 14. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE:
- Uninterrupted or error-free operation
- Accuracy of watchtime tracking or point calculations

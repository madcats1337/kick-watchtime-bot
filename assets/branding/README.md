# Panel branding images

Wide brand images shown inside Components-V2 panels (via a `MediaGallery`).

## shuffle_logo.png — Shuffle verify panel logotype

Shown as a banner at the very top of the Shuffle verify panel.

**Max dimensions:** **1246 × 200 px** (the full Components-V2 content width),
transparent PNG. Keep it within this bound — don't exceed it.

- 1246 px is the widest a MediaGallery image renders inside a Container, so a
  1246-px-wide banner fills the panel edge-to-edge at full resolution (Discord
  downscales it on narrower clients).
- 200 px is the max height — keep the *logotype* (wordmark) within it so the
  banner stays a slim header and doesn't dominate the panel. Any height ≤ 200 px
  is fine; the artwork can be shorter with transparent padding.
- Keep it a wide logotype, not a square icon. Transparent background so it sits
  cleanly on the container's surface.

If `shuffle_logo.png` is missing, the panel still posts — just without the banner.

> Note: the small **square** Shuffle logo used on the *Verify* button is a
> separate file — `assets/emojis/shuffle.png` (128 × 128, uploaded as the bot's
> application emoji). See `assets/emojis/README.md`.

## 🎯 Common Workflows

### Monthly Reset (Recommended)
```
# End of month
!raffledraw                    # Pick winner
!rafflerestart                 # Start new period
# Announce winner in channel
```

### Custom Period
```
# Start custom period
!rafflestart 15 28             # Day 15-28 of current month

# Or specific dates
!rafflesetdate 2025-11-15 2025-11-28

# End when ready
!raffleend
!raffledraw
```

### Emergency Stop
```
!raffleend                     # Stop ticket accumulation
!rafflestats                   # Review stats
!raffledraw                    # Pick winner if ready

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Ending a Period
✅ Check stats: `!rafflestats`
✅ Announce to users
✅ Verify all tickets tracked

### After Drawing Winner
✅ Screenshot winner announcement
✅ Contact winner
✅ Start new period
✅ Announce new period dates

### Date Rules
- Start date must be before end date
- Can't have 2 active periods
- End old period before starting new one (unless using `!rafflerestart`)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"No active raffle period"**
→ Use `!rafflestart` to create one

**"Already an active period"**
→ Use `!raffleend` first, or `!rafflerestart` to auto-handle

**"Invalid date format"**
→ Use `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g., 2025-11-01)

**Need to fix dates?**
→ `!rafflesetdate` updates current period without resetting tickets

---

## 📅 Example Timeline

**Typical Monthly Cycle:**

```
Nov 1, 00:00 UTC  → Period starts (!rafflestart or auto)
Nov 1-30          → Users earn tickets
Nov 30, 23:59 UTC → Period ends (!raffleend or auto)
Dec 1, 00:00 UTC  → Draw winner (!raffledraw)
Dec 1, 00:01 UTC  → New period starts (!rafflestart)
```

**With Auto-Draw Enabled:**
```env
RAFFLE_AUTO_DRAW=true
```
Bot automatically draws winner on 1st of month!

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Announce Early**: Tell users about raffle dates at start of month
2. **Consistent Schedule**: Same dates each month (1st-last day)
3. **Screenshot Winners**: Keep records of all draws
4. **Use Auto-Draw**: Set `RAFFLE_AUTO_DRAW=true` for hands-free
5. **Check Stats Daily**: Monitor participation with `!rafflestats`
